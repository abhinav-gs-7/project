📘 Overview

The Bank Management System (BMS) is a Java-based console application that simulates core banking operations.
It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles — including Encapsulation, Inheritance — to manage different bank entities such as Managers, Employees, and Customers efficiently.

✓ View employee performance and account activities

👩‍💻 Employee Module
